<!--
    - if you add a module or a layout, it'll automatically add/wrap with section
    - so create the card, 3 different cards, so they're all three flat listed in modules
    - what they see as option is based on what card type they choose
    - if width and height are always 100% then will always flex occupy entire space available, test
